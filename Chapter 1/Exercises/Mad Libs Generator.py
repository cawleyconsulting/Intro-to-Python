# The Goal: Inspired by Summer Sons Mad Libs project with Javascript.
# The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs.
# For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc.
# Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade
# story template. Youll need prompts for user input, and to then print out the full story at the end with the
# input included.
