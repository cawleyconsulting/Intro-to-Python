# The Goal: Remember Adventure? Well, were going to build a more basic version of that.
# A complete text game, the program will let users move through rooms based on user input and get
# descriptions of each room. To create this, youll need to establish the directions in which the user can move,
# a way to track how far the user has moved (and therefore which room he/she is in), and to print out a description.
# Youll also need to set limits for how far the user can move. In other words, create walls around the rooms that
# tell the user, You cant move further in this direction.
